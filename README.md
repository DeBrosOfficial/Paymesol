Payme.sol: Your Gateway to Fast, Secure, Decentralized, Peer-to-Peer Solana Payments.

Payme.sol is a mobile decentralized application (dApp) that makes it easy to receive payments on the Solana blockchain. With Payme.sol, you can generate QR codes that contain all the information needed to make a payment, including the amount and your wallet address. Your customers can simply scan the QR code with their smartphone camera to initiate the payment process. No more manual input! Once scanned, the QR code automatically opens Phantom wallet, where they can review the payment details and confirm the transaction with a single tap. This seamless experience eliminates the need for manual amount input and reduces the risk of errors, empowering small business owners and individuals to accept payments with ease and efficiency.

Payme.sol, as an open-source project, currently supports Euro-to-Crypto conversions. Our commitment to open-source development not only fosters community contributions and enhancements but also adds a layer of protection through transparent code review. This collaborative approach ensures that vulnerabilities can be spotted and addressed by a global community of developers, providing safer transactions. We're actively working to expand the range of supported currencies in the future, aiming to make Payme.sol a convenient and secure payment option for everyone, regardless of their location or preferred currency.

Getting Started

1. Install Phantom Wallet

Phantom Wallet is available as a mobile app (iOS, Android) or a browser extension (Chrome, Firefox, Brave). Download it from the official website and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new wallet or import an existing one.
2. Generate Your Payment QR Code

    Open the https://paymesol.app on your mobile device.

    Click the "Connect Wallet" button and follow the on-screen instructions to securely connect your Phantom wallet to Payme.sol. Connecting your wallet to Payme.sol is only to securely retrieve your wallet address, which is used to generate the QR code. We do not have access to your wallet or your funds.

    Choose the Cryptocurrency you want to receive the payment in (e.g., EURC, SOL, USDC).

    Enter the amount you want to receive in Euros. (Other currencies will be supported in the future).

    Click "Generate QR Code" button to create a unique QR code containing all the payment information.

3. Receive the Payment

    The payer must have the cryptocurrency you choose available in their wallet.

    The payer scans the QR code with their smartphone camera.

    The QR code will automatically open their Phantom wallet.

    The payer reviews the payment details and confirms the transaction.

    You will receive the payment in your Phantom wallet.

That's it! You've successfully received a payment using Payme.sol.

Always verify the payment information before proceeding.Remember, blockchain transactions are irreversible.
