<h1 align="left">Payme.sol: Your Gateway to Fast, Secure, Decentralized, Peer-to-Peer Solana Payments.</h1>


Payme.sol is a mobile decentralized application (dApp) that makes it easy to receive payments on the Solana blockchain. With Payme.sol, you can generate QR codes that contain all the information needed to make a payment, including the amount and your wallet address. Your customers can simply scan the QR code with their smartphone camera to initiate the payment process. No more manual input! Once scanned, the QR code automatically opens Phantom wallet, where they can review the payment details and confirm the transaction with a single tap. This seamless experience eliminates the need for manual amount input and reduces the risk of errors, empowering small business owners and individuals to accept payments with ease and efficiency.

Payme.sol, as an open-source project, currently supports Euro-to-Crypto conversions. Our commitment to open-source development not only fosters community contributions and enhancements but also adds a layer of protection through transparent code review. This collaborative approach ensures that vulnerabilities can be spotted and addressed by a global community of developers, providing safer transactions. We're actively working to expand the range of supported currencies in the future, aiming to make Payme.sol a convenient and secure payment option for everyone, regardless of their location or preferred currency.
